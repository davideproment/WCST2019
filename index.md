## When and where?
30th October - 1st November 2019

School of Mathematics, University of East Anglia, Norwich (UK)

## Aim of the workshop
The workshop will bring together physicsts and applied mathematicians researching in the area of waves, coherent structures and turblulence. The even has four sessions corresponding to the following themes:
- Classical vortex dynamics
- Nonlinear waves
- Wave interactions and turbulence
- Coherent structures and topological excitations

Each session will have an introductory lecture on the theme (aimed at the non-experts) and then a handful of more specific talks.
The participation of PhD students, postdocs and early career researchers to the event is particularly encouraged.
Depending on the numbers of participants, a formal poster session might also take place.

## Program
A preliminary program will be drafted by the end of August 2019.
